      <h3>Philosophy</h3>
      <p>
        Every component and primitive offered in this library has been designed with
        two goals in mind.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Large, high performance Javascript applications should be easy to build.</li>
        <li>Performance should not sacrifice flexibility.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Smoke and Mirrors will try it's best to allow you to keep the conventions, structures,
        and layouts you want. If you can't figure out how to do something you want to do,
        open an issue, and either we will point you to an existing demo, or create a new one.
